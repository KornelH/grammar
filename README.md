# Erlang Grammar

TextMate grammar (also used by VS Code) for the Erlang programming language.

## Credits

The grammar has been forked from the original Erlang TextMate bundle:

https://github.com/textmate/erlang.tmbundle

The original license stated:

```
Permission to copy, use, modify, sell and distribute this
software is granted. This software is provided "as is" without
express or implied warranty, and with no claim as to its
suitability for any purpose.
```

The reason of the fork is twofold:

* The original Erlang grammar was not actively maintained and response
  times for Pull Requests were long.
* The grammar can be included in isolation in the VS Code extension
